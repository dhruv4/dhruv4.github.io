<p>Joe started off just like you. A blue collar worker while he was in high school in Nantucket, MA. His family was a typical middle-class American household, where his father ran a small business and his mother was a professor at Wellesley.</p>

<p>But, Joe was ambitious. And, rising from his humble beginnings, Joe became so much more. A truly productive, value-generating American. Armed with his Harvard degree and Yale MBA, and a small half a million loan from his father, Joe rolled up his sleeves and got to work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s not much, but it was usually honest work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went to Wall Street and, with his hedge fund, Waterbridge, and made billions for American shareholders and American industry.</p>

<p>Joe is a true American hero, serving his nation with grit, valor, and diligence through our economic system.</p>
