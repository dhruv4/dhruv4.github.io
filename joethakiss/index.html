<h3>From Main Street to Wall Street</h3>

<p><img src="img/Site_staff_blue_hats_FAO_Celia.jpg" alt="Joe is just like you" class="image-right" /></p>

<p>Joe started off just like you. A blue collar worker while he was in high school in Nantucket, MA. His family was a typical middle-class American household, where his father ran a small business and his mother was a professor at Wellesley.</p>

<p>But, Joe was ambitious. And, rising from his humble beginnings, Joe became so much more. A truly productive, value-generating American. Armed with his Harvard degree and Yale MBA, and a small half a million loan from his father, Joe rolled up his sleeves and got to work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not much, but it was usually honest work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went to Wall Street and, with his hedge fund, Waterbridge, and made billions for American shareholders and American industry.</p>

<p>Joe is a true American hero, serving his nation with grit, valor, and diligence through our economic system.</p>

          <h1>Diligence</h1>

<h4>America is a nation of hard-workers based on our fundamental foundations as pioneers. We Americans work harder than anyone and, those of us who work hard, succeed. We will help support the Americans that don’t work hard with social services.</h4>

<h1>Equality</h1>

<h4>All Americans are born equal. Some have more opportunity, some have more resources. It is imperative that all Americans have an equal opportunity to work for those with more resources.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident. 
All the men and women created by – 
go – you know – you know the thing</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>America</h1>

<h4>This is America. Our American Identity is being threatened by non-American forces. Anyone can be American because America is a kaleidoscope of all sorts of cultures. And that’s why we must protect the American Identity.</h4>

        <h2>COVID-19</h2>
        <h3>Offering support</h3>
        <p>Joe will make handshake deals to support COVID-19. Joe has a history of social distancing and will be sure to continue to distance himself from society.</p>

    <div class="col-right">
        <h2>Healthcare</h2>
        <h3>Medicare for all who want it</h3>
        <p>Everyone should have health insurance. So, we will make sure that healthcare plans are available to purchase from private companies all around America.</p>

        <p>The wealthy don't pay their fair share in taxes. In fact, the wealthy do not even have to pay taxes, according to our accountants. We will leverage our billionaire connections ensure that the wealthy donate some money to the US Federal Government.</p>

        <h2>Gun Control</h2>
        <h3>American lives and rights</h3>
        <p>We will ensure that guns are banned for all those who do not have permits to own and carry guns. We will protect the Second Amendment and allow those who want guns to get guns if they purchase them.</p>

        <h2>Climate Change</h2>
        <h3>Ensure the safety of Americans</h3>
        <p>The biggest threat to the safety of American citizens is climate change. Any changes to the political or economic climates will threaten American energy independence by limiting investment in coal and natural gas.</p>
